After meeting on 24-Juli:
    ? All: add download tables button

    - mccaskill: try to put recursion b4 tables
    + macaskill: p^U to p^u
    ? mccaskill: bp-dotplot : add "0" cells including frame for all cells
    ? mccaskill: dotplots: draw a dot within each cell with radius == sqrt(probability) scaled to cell width
    ? mccaskill: slider 1 = Ebp (default -1)
    ? mccaskill: slider 2 = RT (default 1 and range 1-5)

    - MEA: fix getSubstructures
    - MEA: show all three tables in diff rows
    - MEA: replace +1 in traceback by p^u or p^bp
    - MEA : LIMITED traceback (up to 10 structures)
    - MEA: bug: sequence AU : should be 2*0.731
    ? MEA: show PU array instead of PU table
    ? MEA: update PU recursion information to "1-sum..."
    ? MEA: add 2 sliders for mccaskill computation

    + co-fold: rename nussiFold to co-fold
    + co-fold: change linker length to ll+1
    + co-fold: represent bps across linker with [] (for full structue)
    + co-fold: represent bps across linker with [] (for single cell click)
    ? co-fold: use "x" for linker positions in dot-bracket-string

    - rna-up: add page and impl algo using 4d matrix

    - rna-hyb: add page and impl algo using 4d matrix
