        The

        algorithm by Osamu Gotoh
        computes the optimal, global affine alignment of two sequences.
        The problem with
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4">Needleman-Wunsch (1970)</a>
        was that it does not produce
        biologically relevant alignments.
        Alignments had too many gaps
        and by this reason, the
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(82)90398-9">Gotoh</a>
        algorithm was introduced.
        In this algorithm, the number of gap starts is minimized
        to get biologically better alignments.
        <br>
        <br>
        This done by introducing two additional matrices $P$ and $Q$
        (which are storing the vertical and horizontal gap costs)
        and a new recursion function $D_{i,j}$
        (w.r.t. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4">Needleman-Wunsch</a>).
        The asymptotic runtime
        and space consumption
        is however, not higher than in the
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4">Needleman-Wunsch</a>
        algorithm. Runtime and space are in $\mathcal O(nm)$, where $n=|S_1|$ and $m=|S_2|$.
