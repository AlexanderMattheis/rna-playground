        Different agglomerative (hierarchical) clustering algorithms were proposed to compute phylogenetic trees
        from evolutionary distances:
        <ul>
            <li>
                UPGMA (average linkage) by
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_33927_astatisticalmethodforevaluatin1902">Robert R. Sokal and Charles D. Michener (1958)</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                WPGMA (simple average) by
                <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001316446602600201">Louis L. McQuitty (1967)</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                neighbour-joining (single linkage) by
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040454">Naruya Saitou and Masatoshi Nei (1987)</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        And there exists many approaches and all of them have advantages and disadvantages.
        For example UPGMA (or WPGMA) is very accurate.
        It computes the average distance between all elements in the cluster,
        when the distance to a cluster is recomputed.
        Where as neighbour-joining is less accurate,
        but faster - it looks only at the minimum distance during recomputations.

        <br>
        <br>

        The principle of all agglomerative (bottom-up) approaches is always the same,
        in the beginning you have given a matrix of pairwise evolutionary distances
        between singleton clusters (containing only one element)
        and in this matrix you search for the entry with the lowest value $d_{min} = d_{i,j}$
        (where $i \neq j$). You merge the clusters $i$ and $j$ to a new cluster $ij = i \cup j$
        and recompute the distances to the remaining clusters with some distance formula $dist$
        given with the respective approach.
        Afterwards the distance between $i,j$ and the merged cluster $ij$
        in the tree is set to $\frac{d_{min}}{2}$.
        These stated steps are iterated for $N - 1$ rounds,
        where $N$ is number of input singleton clusters.

        <br>
        <br>

        For the given input, the
        <ul>
            <li>changing distance matrices</li>
            <li>phylogenetic tree</li>
        </ul>
        are computed and displayed in reversed order.
