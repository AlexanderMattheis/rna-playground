# Freiburg RNA algorithms for teaching

This repository contains the Javascript and Html sources for various
algorithms related to RNA structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction.

They were developed in order to enable an example-driven learning and teaching of
RNA structure related algorithms. To reduce the level of complexity,
all algorithms use a simple Nussinov-like energy scoring scheme, i.e.
the energy of an RNA structure is directly related to its number 
of base pairs without further distinction.
