# [Freiburg RNA algorithms for teaching](http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/)

This repository contains the Javascript and Html sources for various
algorithms related to RNA structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction.

They were developed in order to enable an example-driven learning and teaching of
RNA structure related algorithms. To reduce the level of complexity,
all algorithms use a simple Nussinov-like energy scoring scheme, i.e.
the energy of an RNA structure is directly related to its number 
of base pairs without further distinction.

Please refer to the webserver for further information about the algorithms.
