      Different iterative refinement strategies were proposed to improve the Sum-of-Pairs score
      of a progressive alignment
      (e.g. an alignment created with
      <a href="http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/index.jsp?toolName=Feng-Doolittle">Feng-Doolittle</a>)
      like Round-robin, in which the sequences are realigned in the order,
      they have been added to the multiple sequence alignment (using the guide-tree).
      If the score improves through the realignment,
      then the multi-sequence alignment is kept.
      And this approach can also be divided into different strategies:

      <ol>
          <li>
              <em>Minimum Distance-Pair:</em> From each aligned sequence remove gaps and realign immediately against
              the nearest sequence in the distance table you get from
              <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02603120">Feng-Doolittle (1987)</a> algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
              <em>One-vs-All:</em> From each aligned sequence remove gaps and realign immediately against all
              using the progressive alignment procedure of
              <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02603120">Feng-Doolittle</a>.
          </li>
      </ol>

      In the following, we provide the series of accepted (score improving)
      iteratively computed intermediate realignments
      with all calculated pairwise-alignments and their scores.
      The iterative refinement starts from an alignment computed with the
      <a href="http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/index.jsp?toolName=Feng-Doolittle">Feng-Doolittle</a>
      algorithm.
