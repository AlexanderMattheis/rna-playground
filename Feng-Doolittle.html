        The progressive alignment approach by
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02603120">Da-Fei Feng, Russell F. Doolittle (1987)</a>
        computes a multi-sequence-alignment (MSA) of a set of sequences.
        This algorithm shows an approximative alignment approach,
        which finds considerable solutions in a reasonable time.
        <br>
        <br>
        The further below implemented version of this algorithm is a
        combination of several Feng-Doolittle approaches and the affine alignment approach
        by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(82)90398-9">Osamu Gotoh (1982)</a>.
        <br>
        After a pairwise alignment of all input sequences
        with <a href="http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/index.jsp?toolName=Gotoh">Gotoh</a>
        to compute the similarity-scores,
        this altered <a href="10.1016/s0076-6879(96)66023-6">Feng-Doolittle (1996)</a> approach
        uses our for affine alignment modified similarity-to-distance transformation-formula

        $$\quad D(a,b) = -ln(S^{eff}_{a,b} \cdot f)$$

        where $f = 1$ (originally $f = 100$)
        <br>
        and
        $$\quad S^{eff}_{a,b} = \frac{S(a,b) - S^{rand}_{a,b}}{S^{max}_{a,b} - S^{rand}_{a,b}}$$

        where <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="colW150">$S(a,b)$</div>
            <div class="colW400">observed score from the alignment of sequence $a$ with sequence $b$</div>
	    </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="colW150"> $S^{max}_{a,b} = \cfrac{S(a,a)+S(b,b)}{2}$</div>
            <div class="colW400">average score from the alignment of both sequences with themselves</div>
	    </div>

        The computation of $S^{rand}_{a,b}$ is done with an approximate formula
        which has been adapted, <br>
        because of the fusion with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(82)90398-9">Gotoh</a>.
        The new formula is therefore
        $$
        \quad
        \frac{1}{L_{a,b}}
        \bigg(
        \sum_{i \in \mathbb{A}(a)} \sum_{j \in \mathbb{A}(b)}
        s \Big(i,k | i = k \wedge k \in \mathbb{A}(b) \Big)
        \cdot N_a(i) \cdot N_b(j)
        \bigg)
        + N_{a,b}(\_^e) \cdot \beta
        + N_{a,b}(\_^s) \cdot \alpha
        $$

        where <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="colW150">$L_{a,b}$</div>
            <div class="colW400">number of columns in the alignment of $a,b$</div>
	    </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="colW150">$\mathbb{A}(a), \mathbb{A}(b)$</div>
            <div class="colW400">alphabet-sets of sequences $a$ and $b$</div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="colW150">$s(i,k | i = k \wedge k \in \mathbb{A}(b))$</div>
            <div class="colW400">similarity between matching characters $i$ and $k$</div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="colW150">$N_a(i), N_b(j)$</div>
            <div class="colW400">frequency of characters $i$ and $j$ in sequences $a$ and $b$</div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="colW150">$N_{a,b}(\_^e)$</div>
            <div class="colW400">frequency of gaps (enlargements)</div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="colW150">$N_{a,b}(\_^s)$</div>
            <div class="colW400">frequency of gap starts</div>
        </div>

        The distances computed with the given formula are then used
        to create a phylogenetic tree with a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
        In the original
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02603120">Feng-Doolittle</a>
        approach, the clustering algorithm
        of <a href="10.1126/science.155.3760.279">Walter M. Fitch and Emanuel Margoliash (1967)</a>
        has been used.
        <br>
        But, our implementation instead utilizes the UPGMA algorithm
        by Robert R. Sokal and Charles D. Michener (1958) from the article
        "A statistical method for evaluating systematic relationship". <!-- couldn't found DOI-link -->
        <br>
        Once the phylogenetic tree is computed,
        it tells the order in which sequences or groups of sequences
        have to be aligned together to create a multi-sequence-alignment (MSA).
        <br>
        In this connection the "once a gap, always a gap"-rule is applied
        by substituting gaps in groups of sequences
        with a neutral symbol $\#$ before aligning them ($s(\cdot,\#) = s(\#,\cdot) = 0$).
        <br>
        The rule ensures that before made gaps in some subgroup
        of sequences are preserved.
        <br>
        <br>
        For a given input, the stated computation steps
        <ul>
            <li>pairwise alignments</li>
            <li>distance matrix</li>
            <li>phylogenetic tree</li>
            <li>merging</li>
        </ul>
        are calculated and represented in reverse order below.
