          introduced 2000 an approach which
          allows a fast and very accurate computation of multiple sequence alignments,
          the Tree-based Consistency Objective Function for alignment Evaluation (short: T-coffee).
          The advantage to traditional approaches like
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02603120">Feng-Doolittle (1987)</a>
          is that the results are much better.
          That's because the approach is less greedy by using a so called library.
